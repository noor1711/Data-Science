This is regarding the first project submission for the subject UCS757: Building Innovative Systems

Here we are dealing with Multivariate time-series forecasting.

Our Dataset has -
  - 100 samples
  - 10 timelines
  - 13 parameters
  

I chose two models - 
1. Linear Regression
2. Kernel Ridge Regression

The RMSE reported by them were - 
1. Linear Regression - 1.6338872765814707
2. Kernel Ridge Regression - 0.06760438138589527

Kernel Ridge clearly shows superior performance
